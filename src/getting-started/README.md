# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Node 13.x, `npm`, `yarn`, `solc` v0.5.16, `git`, `python`, `g++`, and `make` are all needed to be installed on the system before using either repository. With the exception of the Node.js-specific tooling, many of these should be available on a basic Linux installation out of the box.

`libusb` and `libudev` are also required for the `compound-protocol` repo.

Note that if you have a newer version of `solc`, you will need to install the older version to build Compound protocol contracts.

We will be providing instructions on how to install most of these dependencies below, so don't worry!
